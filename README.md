C++11 Data Access Pattern library

Overview
--------

The Dap library allows you to parameterize data access patterns, separate from algorithms.

It also includes SIMD support for AVX (32x8 and 64x4), NEON (32x4), and SSE(32x4 and 64x2) which 
is automatically selected based on architecture and template parameters.
